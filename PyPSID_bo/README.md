# PSID: Preferential subspace identification (BEHAVIOUR ONLY) <br/> [Python implementation]

This is a modified version of the original Python implementation of [PSID](https://github.com/ShanechiLab/PyPSID) from Sani et al. 2021. In this modified implementation, the code nearly identical, but the projections from behaviour onto neural activity have been removed. Instead, these projections have been replaced with the actual behaviour which has no neural information. The aim of this re-implementatioon is to provide a baseline for decoding performance.
